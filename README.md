# Pokémon Emerald Speedchoice Edition

## Sceptross' changes from Revo's original Speedchoice ROM:

- Sweet Scent's animation has been removed for faster usage
- Rock Smash only generates 2 encounters, with 60 and 40 percent probability each
- The rods have once again been split up, but they will still generate the same two encounters across all three rods
- The easy evolution quality of life changes from Fire Red have been ported to Emerald (Espeon and Umbreon evolving via stone and Feebas evolving at level 35).
- Fixed bug where "Evo Every Level" options were accidentally swapped
- The bicycle can no longer be used indoors

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald with changes made to be more speedrun friendly.
